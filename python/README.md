or alternatively `pip-tools` with [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)

```shell
./compile-requirements.sh
```

## Code formatting and linting

These are configured with a custom line length limit of 120.
The configs can be found in [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml).

Usage:

```shell
ruff format
ruff check --fix
```

These can also be integrated to IDEs / editors or run as a pre-commit hook.
See the documentation for the [Ruff extension](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) for VS Code.

Using with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) (run from repo root):

pre-commit install

# run manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```
